Getting Started
=================
Just drag the two classes into your project. Also you need to import MessageUI framework. Go to frameworks-> add existing framework-> MessageUI.framework

Added the import in your project file YourProject-Prefix.pch

    #import "SCLogger.h"

**or**

Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to get start, you can add following line to your Podfile:

    pod 'SCLogger'

Add in what settings you want the log is active in your Podfile.
For example Debug or Release.

    post_install do |installer|
          installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
              target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                  if config.name == 'Debug'
                      config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)', 'DEBUG=1', 'SCLOGGER_DEBUG=1']
                  end
              end
          end
      end


Added the import in your project file YourProject-Prefix.pch

    #import <SCLogger/SCLogger.h>

If **Xcode 6 or higher** is required to create a PCH file, add the path of the PCH in the bundle settings and allow `Precompile Prefix Header = YES`

Example Usage
=============

To use the component is very easy, if your project has already added the import on PCH, just **three-finger long press** on debug or call the method

    [SCLogger showDebug];

To add gesture you need to call the method after `[window makeKeyAndVisible]` or end of method `- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions`

    [SCLogger enabledGesture];
    
For all **NSLog** or **NSLogv** used in the project will be recorded in SCLogger also is recorded in a log file.
In the debug screen it is possible to send the log via email with the gesture.

    tapReconEmail.numberOfTapsRequired = 1;
    tapReconEmail.numberOfTouchesRequired = 2;
